# Simple-Protein-Sequence-Generator-With-BERT-Model
The BERT-based Protein Sequence Generator is a model that utilizes the capabilities of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to generate protein sequences. It has been designed with a focus on simplicity.

Proteins play a vital role in various biological processes, and understanding their sequences is crucial for studying their functions and interactions. However, the complexity of protein sequences poses a challenge for researchers and scientists. The Simple Protein Sequence Generator aims to simplify this process by utilizing the BERT model, which has demonstrated remarkable performance in natural language processing tasks.

The BERT model is a state-of-the-art language representation model that has been pre-trained on vast amounts of text data. By adapting BERT to the protein domain, the generator can learn the intricate patterns and relationships present in protein sequences. This enables it to generate accurate and biologically relevant sequences, aiding in protein engineering, drug discovery, and other molecular biology research areas.

With the Simple Protein Sequence Generator, users can input specific criteria such as desired length, amino acid composition, or even incorporate known motifs or patterns. The generator then employs the BERT model to generate a sequence that fulfills the given criteria while adhering to the constraints and rules of protein structure and function. The resulting sequences can be easily exported for further analysis or experimentation.

# PHASE ONE:
To fine-tune a BERT model on sequences with a masking approach on both the sequence and label, we have to follow these steps:

#### Preprocessing the data: 
Convert  sequences and labels into the appropriate format for BERT. This typically involves tokenizing the text and adding special tokens like [CLS] and [SEP] as per BERT's input format requirements. Use a library like Hugging Face's transformers for this purpose.

#### Preparing the data for fine-tuning: 
Convert  preprocessed data into tensors or any suitable format for training. Use PyTorch or TensorFlow, depending on your preference.

    
#### Loading the pre-trained BERT model: 
Download the pre-trained BERT model from the Hugging Face model repository. Use models like bert-base-uncased or any other variant based on your requirements.

#### Building the classification model:
Create a classification model by adding a classification layer on top of the pre-trained BERT model. Add a linear layer or a fully connected layer followed by a softmax activation function to predict the label probabilities.

#### Fine-tune the model: 
Train the classification model on preprocessed and prepared data. Use a suitable loss function like cross-entropy loss and an optimizer such as Adam or SGD. Iterate over your training data for several epochs, adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the loss.

#### Evaluate the model: 
Once training is complete, evaluate the model's performance on a separate validation set or using cross-validation. Calculate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's effectiveness.

#### Save the model: 
Save the trained model for future use. You can save the entire model or just the parameters, depending on your preference.

#### Inference on new sequences: 
To classify new sequences using the trained model, you need to follow similar preprocessing steps as mentioned earlier. Tokenize the input sequence, add special tokens, and convert the tokens into tensors. Then, pass the preprocessed input through the trained classification model and obtain the predicted label probabilities. You can use the argmax function to select the most likely label or choose a threshold to filter out low-confidence predictions.
